We named our project as Smart Agent (SA)
Our code has comments. And printed a lot of information you may need. We finished all the questions except bonus.



Using SA can help you find the target really fast （minimize total  distance  traveled’  +  ‘number  of  searches）
steps1. run SA we will have a 50*50 maze with flat,hilly,forested,caves (each of ther with probability 0.25)
steps2. Our SA with run improveAgent that is our SA in problem4. You can change it to basic1 or 2.
steps3. You will know the cells we explored and the cost of our actions( total  distance  traveled’  +  ‘number  of  searches)
